      "descLong": "I worked on a project aimed at developing an autonomous resupply drone to meet soldiers' first aid and ammunition needs on the battlefield more quickly, safely, and efficiently. Within this scope, the goal was for soldiers to digitally indicate the type of supplies they needed through a wristband designed by my team, and for the drone to receive this information, select the appropriate supply package, and deliver it via autonomous route planning. My objective in the project was to support operational continuity, enhance personnel safety by reducing the need for manual resupply in high-risk areas, and achieve savings in both time and cost. We received a cash prize from the Minister of Industry and Technology for this project."

      "descLong": "In the transportation sector, drivers continuing to drive using tachograph devices belonging to others after their own device's duration had expired caused both legal violations and an increased risk of fatigue-related accidents. To address this issue, I worked on an integrated system that performs face recognition-based tachograph verification and real-time sleep–wakefulness monitoring. When a driver scanned their tachograph device into the system, I planned for the in-vehicle camera to analyze the driver's face and check whether it matched the device's actual owner. After verification, the system was intended to monitor the driver's alertness in real time during driving using AI-supported image processing techniques, and issue an audible warning if drowsiness or inattention was detected. With this project, I aimed both to prevent tachograph misuse and to enhance driver safety."

This project not only saved time but also significantly reduced the workload of the canteen staff."
